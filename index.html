						As both a French and American citizen, I have developed an American work ethic coupled with a multicultural perspective. I am eager to learn and passionate about my work, never hesitating to put my best foot forward and get the job done. With a diverse experience in the service industry, I have learned to collaborate with peers from a variety of different backgrounds, developing my patience and cultural understanding. I hope to bring these skills to a professional environment and strive for success in an engaging field.</p>

				<h2><strong>Sculpting</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I started sculpting with clay in the beginning of my junior year. It is the first artistic medium where I find I have a natural capacity and interest.
